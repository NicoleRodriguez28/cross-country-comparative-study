# Cross-Country Analysis Life Expectancy vs. GDP in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Morocco
## Overview
This analysis explores the relationship between *life expectancy* and *GDP per capita* in three distinct regions: Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Morocco, using data from the `Gapminder` dataset. Through a series of interactive scatterplots, this project visualizes how economic, and health indicators have evolved over time in each country.

## Key Insights
- **Morocco** has the *lowest life expectancy* and *largest population* among the three. Despite steady economic growth, life expectancy improvements are gradual.
- **Puerto Rico** leads in both *GDP per capita* and *life expectancy*, suggesting a stronger correlation between economic development and public health.
- **Cuba** shows a relatively stable *GDP*, but with a weaker correlation between income and life expectancy compared to the other countries.
